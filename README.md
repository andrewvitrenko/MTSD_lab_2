## Variant

No = 1107

## Getting started
Requirements: installed 16+ [node.js](https://nodejs.org)

1. Clone repo
2. Run `npm i`
3. Run `node .` to run project
4. Run `npm run test` to run tests

## Failed tests
CI failed on several commits
1. [first](https://github.com/andrewvitrenko/MTSD_lab_2/commit/1bf8aaeb990bca21676ad7c1f10b7d81127be604)
2. [second](https://github.com/andrewvitrenko/MTSD_lab_2/commit/0669ea10dba9f6872792336fe59f8cba837b5dc4)

## Conclusion
Tests were pretty useful while refactoring code to Doubly Linked List Structure. It helped to keep track of methods' interfaces. But with first implementation on arrays it was redundant, because code was pretty simple
